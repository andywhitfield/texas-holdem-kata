- The interface has two related methods, 'deal' and 'holeCards' which
mean having to keep track of the 'last player' in an instance variable.
Could make this interface better.

- Hard-coding of the winner text.

- Repetitive code for the dealTurn, dealRiver implementations.

- The community cards are added to each players list of cards. Is the
model correct? Perhaps we need to add the concept of a 'deal'.

- PokerRound results method getting unwieldy.

- PokerRound now has three collections containing players names. Possibly
missing some abstraction here.

- In the RoundWinners class, we need to remove the hard-coded result. We
need to be able to find a player's highest card. Could do with a proper
class at this point rather than the string (e.g. "Ac" representing the Ace
of Clubs).

- Multiple cases where we are constructing a list of cards - could
potentially overload the Card.from method.
