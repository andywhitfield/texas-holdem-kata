- The interface has two related methods, 'deal' and 'holeCards' which
mean having to keep track of the 'last player' in an instance variable.
Could make this interface better.

- Hard-coding of the winner text.

- Repetitive code for the dealTurn, dealRiver implementations.

- The community cards are added to each players list of cards. Is the
model correct? Perhaps we need to add the concept of a 'deal'.

- No ability to support a player 'folding'.
