- Don't think we support folding pre-flop?

- Does the PairIdentifier class need to also accept three of a kind/2 pairs
etc? I don't think so, but we will need some tests around these conditions
once there are three-of-a-kind/full house/etc... identifiers.

- There is duplication between Pair and TwoPair - especially in the
identification of the kickers - this could probably easily be moved to
a common location.

- Pair and TwoPair also contain similarities in the ContainsAtLeastOnePair
class: can this be consolidated?

- The tests are getting annoying to write: can this be improved.
