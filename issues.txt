- Don't think we support folding pre-flop?

- Does the PairIdentifier class need to also accept three of a kind/2 pairs
etc? I don't think so, but we will need some tests around these conditions
once there are three-of-a-kind/full house/etc... identifiers.

- The aceLow implementation within StraightIdentifier is less than obvious.
Some refactoring should be done here.
